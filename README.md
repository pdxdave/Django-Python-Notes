Make sure Pip is up todate. This is for Mac.        
```
sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
```

Setup the pip virtual environment.  Do this locally to the file instead of globally.  It's done this way.

```
pipenv install
```

When done you'll see something like...    
```
✔ Successfully created virtual environment! 
Virtualenv location: /Users/davidmartinson/.local/share/virtualenvs/_Python_practice-PzhcMqkK
