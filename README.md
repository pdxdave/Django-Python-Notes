Make sure Pip is up todate. This is for Mac.        
```
sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
```

Setup the pip environment.  Do this locally to the file instead of globally.  It's done this way.
```
pip install pipenv
```

Next to create the virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```

When done you'll see something like...    
```
✔ Successfully created virtual environment! 
Virtualenv location: /Users/davidmartinson/.local/share/virtualenvs/_Python_practice-PzhcMqkK
